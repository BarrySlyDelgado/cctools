/** @file linkedlist.h Robust, reentrant linked list structure.
 *
 * Aside from list create and delete operations, most functionality
 * is based on cursors on a list. A cursor is a
 * logical position within a list. Due to insertions and deletions,
 * a simple numeric index is not sufficient to define a constant
 * position. Cursors are unaffected by changes in other parts of
 * the list. Lookups, insertions, deletions, etc. all happen at
 * the current location of a cursor. Cursors also support iteration,
 * by moving forward and backward in the list.
 *
 * After creation, a cursor's position is undefined. It could be thought
 * of as sitting at index -âˆž. Insertions in this state always place
 * the item at the head of the list, and the cursor's position is
 * unaffected. Calls that examine the value under a cursor fail if the
 * position is undefined.
 *
 * To interact with the contents of a list, a cursor must be placed on
 * a list item by moving forward/backward or by seeking to a specific
 * index. Negative indices are interpreted relative to the tail of the
 * list, so index 0 is the head, and index -1 is the tail.
 *
 * If a cursor is on an item that is deleted, it is automatically shifted
 * on to the next item. If there are no items to the right, or if they
 * are all subsequently deleted, the cursor's position becomes undefined.
